.. contents:: This post shows two approaches to wait for all goroutines_ to
              finish.

Channel [1]_
++++++++++++

Wait for all goroutines to finish via channels_:

.. rubric:: `Run Code on Go Playground <https://play.golang.org/p/dHYMGZNbnj5>`__
   :class: align-center

.. code-block:: go

  package main

  import (
  	"fmt"
  )

  func routine(site string, c chan int) {
  	defer func() { c <- 1 }()

  	// do something
  	fmt.Println(site)
  }

  func main() {
  	c := make(chan int)

  	sites := []string{
  		"https://www.google.com/",
  		"https://duckduckgo.com/",
  		"https://www.bing.com/"}

  	for _, site := range sites {
  		go routine(site, c)
  	}

  	// wait all goroutines to finish
  	for i := 0; i < len(sites); i++ {
  		<-c
  	}
  }


.. adsu:: 2


sync.WaitGroup [4]_
+++++++++++++++++++

Wait for all goroutines to finish via sync.WaitGroup_:

.. rubric:: `Run Code on Go Playground <https://play.golang.org/p/7jSEcLb5SyD>`__
   :class: align-center

.. code-block:: go

  package main

  import (
  	"fmt"
  	"sync"
  )

  var wg sync.WaitGroup

  func routine(site string) {
  	// Decrement the counter when the goroutine completes.
  	defer wg.Done()

  	// do something
  	fmt.Println(site)
  }

  func main() {
  	sites := []string{
  		"https://www.google.com/",
  		"https://duckduckgo.com/",
  		"https://www.bing.com/"}

  	for _, site := range sites {
  		// Increment the WaitGroup counter.
  		wg.Add(1)

  		go routine(site)
  	}

  	// wait all goroutines to finish
  	wg.Wait()
  }
