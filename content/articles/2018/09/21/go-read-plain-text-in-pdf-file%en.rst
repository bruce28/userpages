I read the thread about extracting text from PDF on Reddit. [1]_ It's
interesting and I made some searches [2]_ and decided to try
`github.com/ledongthuc/pdf`_ package. The following code comes from modification
of sample code of the package.

.. show_github_file:: siongui userpages content/code/go/read-pdf-text/readpdftext.go

**Usage**

.. show_github_file:: siongui userpages content/code/go/read-pdf-text/readpdftext_test.go

.. adsu:: 2

Tested on: ``Ubuntu Linux 18.04``, ``Go 1.11``
